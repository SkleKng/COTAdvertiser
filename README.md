## Notes

This program is completely TOS FRIENDLY :))))))  
Aditionally, this program can run in the background without any issues  

Make sure you specify a line indented file of discord channels, and the account you log in to is in said servers. You must be in the following servers to use the provided file:

https://discord.gg/RM9KqbnQec  
https://discord.gg/nqssXF2xXH

I encourage making a batch file for easy execution. A typical file may look like this:  
```bash
python3 C:\Users\vimal\OneDrive\Desktop\VSCode\COTAdvertiser.py -i C:\Users\vimal\OneDrive\Desktop\VSCode\servers.txt -u *USERNAME* -p *PASSWORD*
```
